"""Fetch publications from Google Scholar and write data/publications.json.

Uses the `scholarly` library routed through free public proxies so it works from
GitHub Actions runners, whose datacenter IPs Google Scholar otherwise blocks.

Retries with fresh proxies a few times. If every attempt fails (or no
publications come back), it exits non-zero WITHOUT writing, so a blocked run
never clobbers the existing publications list.
